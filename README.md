### Supporting more Arrows 

This mod adds a new `real_arrow_tip:charge_type` for the crossbow and bow item. It sets the item identifier of the currently used arrow as its value, making it possible to support any arrow.

The texture pack needs to include the required arrow textures (see this modâ€™s resource pack for examples) and update `minecraft/items/bow.json` and `minecraft/items/crossbow.json` to reference the new textures.

To create these `.json` files, you can use `item-model-generator.py.` Simply add the new arrows, and the `.json` files will be generated.

Note:
Supporting modded arrows is outside the scope of this mod.
Feel free to publish any resource pack that adds compatibility for modded arrows.
